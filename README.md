# REACT_VITEJS_STARTER 
## (REACT⚛️ + VITEJS⚡️ + ABSOLUTE IMPORTES📦 + ESLINT🔥 + PRETTIER🦋 BASIC CONFIG)

I really liked the vitejs tool, so I decided to make a personalized boiler plate project similar to create-react-app.
I made this repo as private first. But After researching a lot, I got to know there are a lot of issues for React developers switching from cra to vitejs, especially for Beginners.
So, I have made this repo public😄.

#### NOTE : As I am gonna work more and more, I am gonna do my best to add some more functionalities to this Template!.
